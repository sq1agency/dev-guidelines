# Sq1 Development Guidelines

This is a collection of guidelines designed to help make development life a
little easier for everyone, old and new. Follow these guidelines, but if you
find yourself disagreeing with an aspect of these guidelines, open a pull
request on this repo and we can talk through it! When all else fails, we put
disagreements on the guidelines to a team vote.
